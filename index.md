## Favorite CPCS 120L Labs

Lab 1 part 1
I like this lab because of how simple it was. Also because I had no idea how to use terminal or vs code at the time, but my partner did. I got to know how to know all the git commands and shortcuts like how to save on vs code without having to stumble through directions by myself.

Lab 3 part 1
I liked this lab because it reminded me of the medical classes I took back in high school. I initially thought about taking a medical pathway in college until I learned about the working hours. Also it was good practice on how to use doubles so that's a nice extra touch.

Lab 6 part 2
This was one of my favorites because I already knew how to play blackjack and other card games. Besides being good practice for if statements I already knew all the cards and their values beforehand so it was the least brain numbing of labs. Also I just really like card games whether its poker, speed, blackjack and so on.
